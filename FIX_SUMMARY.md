# Live Transcription App - Dependency Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve dependency issues and make the application fully functional with Ivrit models.

## Problems Identified

1. **Model Structure Mismatch**: The `faster_whisper` models were wrapped in a dict structure in `load_model()` but not properly unwrapped when used in transcription functions.

2. **Missing OpenAI Whisper**: The Dockerfile.ivrit didn't install `openai-whisper`, causing import errors when the app tried to check for its availability.

3. **Inconsistent Model Access**: Different parts of the code accessed the model differently, causing errors with `faster_whisper` models.

4. **No Support for faster_whisper in Streaming**: The `transcribe_audio_stream` function didn't have a handler for `faster_whisper` models.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. app.py Modifications

#### Fixed Model Structure Handling
- **transcribe_chunk()**: Added proper unwrapping of the wrapped `faster_whisper` model structure
- **transcribe_audio_stream()**: Added complete `faster_whisper` support for streaming transcription
- Ensured consistent model access pattern throughout the codebase

```python
# Handle wrapped faster_whisper model structure
if isinstance(model, dict) and model.get("type") == "faster_whisper":
    actual_model = model["model"]
else:
    actual_model = model
```

#### Improved Dependency Handling
- Added startup logging to show which dependencies are available
- Implemented smart default model selection based on available dependencies
- Enhanced error messages when required dependencies are missing

#### Default Model Selection Logic
```python
# Auto-select based on what's available
if FASTER_WHISPER_AVAILABLE:
    default_model = "ivrit-ct2"  # Use Ivrit CT2 model if faster_whisper is available
elif WHISPER_CPP_AVAILABLE:
    default_model = "ivrit-large-v3-turbo"  # Use GGML model if whisper.cpp is available
elif OPENAI_WHISPER_AVAILABLE:
    default_model = "large"  # Fallback to OpenAI Whisper
elif DEEPGRAM_AVAILABLE and DEEPGRAM_API_KEY:
    default_model = "deepgram"  # Use Deepgram if available
```

### 2. requirements.ivrit.txt Updates
- Added `openai-whisper` as an optional, commented dependency
- Documented that it's optional to avoid conflicts with `faster-whisper`

### 3. Dockerfile.ivrit Enhancements
- Added optional installation of `openai-whisper` with error handling
- Installation won't fail the build if `openai-whisper` conflicts with other packages
- Added verification step to check which packages were successfully installed

```dockerfile
# Optional: Install openai-whisper for fallback support (with error handling)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir openai-whisper==20231117 || echo "openai-whisper installation skipped - app will use faster-whisper models only"
```

### 4. Testing Scripts
Created comprehensive testing scripts:
- **test_docker_build.sh**: Tests Docker build and validates imports within the container
- **test_app_locally.py**: Validates the app configuration and model loading locally

## How the App Now Works

1. **Graceful Degradation**: The app checks which dependencies are available at startup and adapts accordingly.

2. **Model Priority**:
   - First choice: Ivrit CT2 models via `faster_whisper` (best for Hebrew)
   - Second choice: GGML models via whisper.cpp (if available)
   - Third choice: OpenAI Whisper models (if installed)
   - Fallback: Deepgram API (if configured)

3. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages indicate which dependency is missing for each model type.

4. **Unified Model Access**: All transcription functions now properly handle the wrapped model structure for `faster_whisper`.

## Testing the Fixes

### With Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -f Dockerfile.ivrit -t live-transcription-ivrit .

# Run with docker-compose (includes GPU support)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ivrit.yml up

# Or run standalone
docker run -p 8009:8009 --env-file .env live-transcription-ivrit
```

### Test Scripts
```bash
# Test Docker build
./test_docker_build.sh

# Test local setup (requires dependencies)
python3 test_app_locally.py
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **On Startup**: The app logs which dependencies are available
2. **Model Loading**: Automatically selects the best available model
3. **Transcription**: Works with any available model type (faster_whisper, OpenAI, GGML, Deepgram)
4. **Error Messages**: Clear indication of what's missing if a model fails to load

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Logs**: Look at the startup logs to see which dependencies are detected
2. **Verify Model**: Ensure the `WHISPER_MODEL` environment variable points to an available model
3. **GPU Issues**: If CUDA errors occur, try setting `IVRIT_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8` and `IVRIT_DEVICE=cpu`
4. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size or use smaller models

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables for Ivrit models:
- `WHISPER_MODEL`: Model to use (e.g., "ivrit-ct2", "ivrit-v3-turbo")
- `IVRIT_DEVICE`: Device to use ("cuda" or "cpu")
- `IVRIT_COMPUTE_TYPE`: Compute precision ("float16" for GPU, "int8" for CPU)
- `IVRIT_BEAM_SIZE`: Beam search size (default: 5)

## Conclusion

The application is now fully compatible with Ivrit models and handles missing dependencies gracefully. The modular approach allows it to work with whatever dependencies are available, preferring the best option but falling back to alternatives when needed.
