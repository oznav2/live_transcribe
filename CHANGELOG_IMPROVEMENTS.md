# Application Improvements - Changelog

## Date: 2024-10-30

### 1. URL-Based Download Caching System ✅

**Problem Solved:** When users switched between transcription models (e.g., from Deepgram to Ivrit/Whisper), the application would re-download the entire audio file, wasting bandwidth and time.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added a new URL-based download cache system in `cache/downloads/` directory
- Files are cached with SHA256 hash of URL (16 chars) + timestamp
- Cache persists for 24 hours with automatic cleanup
- In-memory cache mapping for fast lookups

**Key Changes:**
- New functions added:
  - `init_download_cache_dir()` - Initialize and clean old cache files
  - `get_url_hash()` - Generate unique hash for URLs
  - `get_cached_download()` - Check if URL already downloaded
  - `save_download_to_cache()` - Save downloads for reuse
- Modified download functions to check cache first:
  - `download_audio_with_ffmpeg()` - Added `use_cache` parameter
  - `download_audio_with_ytdlp()` - Added `use_cache` parameter
- Smart cleanup: Cached files are NOT deleted after transcription
- New API endpoints for cache management:
  - GET `/api/download-cache/stats` - View cache statistics and files
  - POST `/api/download-cache/clear` - Clear download cache

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates redundant downloads when switching models
- Saves bandwidth and reduces latency
- Particularly useful for large audio files
- Complete files cached (duration=0) for all models to use

### 2. Transcription Progress Feedback Fix ✅

**Problem Solved:** Users weren't receiving progress updates when using local Whisper or Ivrit models with yt-dlp downloaded files.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added progress tracking for yt-dlp download path transcriptions
- Implemented async execution with periodic status updates
- Progress updates sent every 5 seconds with elapsed time

**Key Changes:**
- Modified transcription logic in `websocket_transcribe()`:
  - Wrapped OpenAI Whisper calls in `run_in_executor()`
  - Wrapped whisper.cpp (Ivrit) calls in `run_in_executor()`
  - Added progress monitoring loop with 5-second intervals
  - Sends `transcription_status` messages with elapsed time
- Progress format: "Transcribing... (Xm Ys elapsed)"

**Benefits:**
- Users see real-time progress during long transcriptions
- Better UX - no more blank waiting screens
- Consistent behavior across all transcription modes

### 3. Additional Improvements ✅

**Deepgram VOD Enhancement:**
- Changed from 60-second downloads to complete file downloads
- Enables caching for Deepgram fallback downloads
- Better transcription quality with complete audio

**Cleanup Logic Improvements:**
- Smart cleanup that preserves cached files
- Only deletes temporary files outside cache directories
- Prevents accidental deletion of reusable downloads

**Cache Management:**
- Automatic 24-hour expiration for old cache files
- Startup cleanup of expired downloads
- API endpoints for monitoring and manual cleanup

## Testing Considerations

### What Was Tested:
1. **Syntax Validation:** Python compilation successful
2. **Import Dependencies:** All required imports present
3. **Logic Flow:** Caching checks before downloads
4. **Cleanup Safety:** Cached files preserved correctly
5. **Progress Updates:** Async execution with monitoring

### Expected Behavior:
1. First download of a URL creates a cached copy
2. Subsequent model switches use cached file instantly
3. Progress updates appear every 5 seconds during transcription
4. Cached files persist for 24 hours
5. API endpoints provide cache visibility and control

---

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Model Switching
```
1. User transcribes URL with Deepgram
   → Downloads complete file, saves to cache
2. User switches to Ivrit model
   → Uses cached file instantly, no re-download
3. User switches to Whisper large
   → Uses same cached file, no re-download
```

### Scenario 2: Progress Feedback
```
1. User selects Ivrit model for long audio
2. Download completes (with progress)
3. Transcription starts
   → "Starting transcription with Ivrit model..."
   → "Transcribing... (5s elapsed)"
   → "Transcribing... (10s elapsed)"
   → "Transcribing... (1m 15s elapsed)"
4. Results delivered
```

### Scenario 3: Cache Management
```bash
# Check cache status
GET /api/download-cache/stats

# Clear cache if needed
POST /api/download-cache/clear
```

## Technical Notes

- Cache directory: `cache/downloads/`
- Cache key format: `{url_hash_16}_{timestamp}.wav`
- Memory cache: `URL_DOWNLOADS` dictionary
- Cleanup trigger: Application startup + 24-hour expiry
- File preservation: Checks `Path.parents` for cache directory

---

## No Breaking Changes

All improvements are backward compatible:
- Existing functionality preserved
- Optional caching (can be disabled)
- Graceful fallbacks on cache failures
- Same API for WebSocket communication
- Progress updates use existing message types
