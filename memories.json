Reduce chunk duration (30s → 10s or 15s)\n2. Increase queue size (but just delays the problem)\n3. Skip chunks when queue is full (already doing this)\n4.

PyPI docs show whisper requires PyTorch >=1.10.1 with no upper limit, so torch 2.1.2+cu118 should be compatible. Need to check if pip install is actually failing during the build process. My fix should work in theory (install torch CUDA first, then requirements.txt), but need to verify the actual build logs.",

My fix installs torch 2.1.2+cu118 FIRST, then when requirements.txt is processed, pip sees torch already installed (2.1.2+cu118 satisfies ==2.1.2 requirement due to local version identifier), so it doesn't reinstall torch and openai-whisper installs cleanly. Also removed torch lines from requirements.txt to prevent any reinstallation attempts.",
