Reduce chunk duration (30s → 10s or 15s)\n2. Increase queue size (but just delays the problem)\n3. Skip chunks when queue is full (already doing this)\n4.

Added download_audio_with_ffmpeg() at line 203 - uses ffmpeg directly with loudnorm filter\n2. Updated transcribe_vod_with_deepgram() at line 927 to use ffmpeg instead of yt-dlp\n3. Includes fallback mechanism if loudnorm fails (simpler settings)\n4. Better error logging - shows actual ffmpeg errors in server logs\n\nWhy this works:\n- test_deepgram.py uses ffmpeg directly and works perfectly\n- ffmpeg handles HLS streams better than yt-dlp in containers\n- Has built-in fallback for compatibility issues\n- Same proven method used in successful test script\n\nAll migration fixes remain intact:\n- Phase 1: --hls-use-mpegts removed\n- Phase 2: detect_language=True for file upload\n- Phase 3: language=multi for streaming\n- Deepgram SDK 5.2.0 with compatible pydantic 2.12.3",

Download Errors (ffmpeg):\n   - Extracts actual error from stderr\n   - Detects common HTTP errors: 410 (expired), 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found)\n   - Provides actionable suggestions for each error type\n   - Uses emoji indicators: ❌ (error), 💡 (suggestion), 🔄 (retry), 🔴 (final failure)\n   - Sends detailed error to user via WebSocket with common causes listed\n\n2. No Transcript Errors (Deepgram):\n   - Extracts detected language and confidence from response\n   - Lists possible causes when no speech detected\n   - Checks file size to warn about very small files\n   - Sends user-friendly message: \"No speech detected in audio. The file may contain only music, silence, or unclear speech.\"\n   - Logs detailed info on success: language, confidence, request ID\n\n3. Success Logging:\n   - Shows detected language\n   - Shows confidence score\n   - Shows request ID for tracking\n   - Format: \"✓ Transcription complete (X chars) | Language: es | Confidence: 0.94 | Request ID: xxx\"\n\nUsers now get clear, actionable error messages instead of generic failures.",

Increased queue size from 50 to 200 chunks (handles slower models)\n2. Implemented backpressure mechanism - audio capture waits up to 5 seconds for queue space instead of immediately dropping chunks\n3. Better logging: debug messages show queue state, warnings only when critically full\n4. User warning when selecting slow models (large, ivrit, medium)\n\nBEFORE: Queue dropped chunks constantly with \"Audio queue full; evicted oldest chunk\"\nAFTER: Queue uses backpressure to slow audio capture, matching transcription speed\n\nChanges at:\n- Line 134: AUDIO_QUEUE_SIZE = 200\n- Lines 667-685: Backpressure queue handling\n- Lines 1476-1482: User warning for slow models",

      "content": "ROBUST SOLUTION: Implemented batch transcription for Whisper/Ivrit models (Vibe-style approach)\n\nPROBLEM: Queue overflow with Whisper/Ivrit models causing missing transcript lines\nROOT CAUSE: Real-time streaming transcription too slow for Whisper - queue fills up and drops chunks\n\nSOLUTION IMPLEMENTED (based on Vibe project research):\n1. VOD Detection: Automatically detect if URL is VOD (video/audio file) vs live stream\n2. Batch Mode for VOD: Download COMPLETE file first, then transcribe (no streaming)\n3. Streaming Mode: Only for true live streams (not VOD)\n\nKEY CHANGES:\n- Lines 1806-1888: New batch transcription mode for Whisper/Ivrit\n  * Downloads complete file with ffmpeg (duration=0)\n  * Transcribes entire file in one go\n  * Sends results in chunks to UI\n  * NO queue overflow possible - all audio loaded first\n  \n- Lines 203-287: Updated download_audio_with_ffmpeg to support complete file downloads\n  * duration=0 means download complete file (no time limit)\n  * Works with both primary and fallback commands\n\nBENEFITS:\n- ✅ NO data loss - all audio transcribed\n- ✅ NO queue overflow - batch mode has no queue\n- ✅ NO missing lines - complete file processed\n- ✅ Better quality - Whisper sees full context\n- ✅ Vibe-proven approach - load all, then transcribe\n\nMODES:\n- Deepgram: Still uses streaming (fast enough)\n- Whisper/Ivrit + VOD: Batch mode (download first)\n- Whisper/Ivrit + Live Stream: Streaming mode (real-time)",
